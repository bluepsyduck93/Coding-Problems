## Iterative In-order Traversal - Very Hard 1
Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and traverses it using the in-order traversal technique but without using recursion. 

As the tree is being traversed, a callback function passed in as an argument to the main function should be called on each node (i.e. callback(currentNode)). 

Each Binary Tree node has a value stored in a property called "value," a parent node in a property called "parent," and two children nodes stored in properties called "left" and "right," respectively. 

Children nodes can either be Binary Tree nodes themselves or the None (null) value.


## Max Profit With K Transactions - Very Hard 2
You are given an array of integers representing the prices of a single stock on various days (each index in the array represents a different day). 

You are also given an integer k, which represents the number of transactions you are allowed to make. One transaction consists of buying the stock on a given day and selling it on another, later day. 

Write a function that returns the maximum profit that you can make buying and selling the stock, given k transactions. 

Note that you can only hold 1 share of the stock at a time; in other words, you cannot buy more than 1 share of the stock on any given day, and you cannot buy a share of the stock if you are still holding another share.
